# MazeSolver

This project implements a maze-solving algorithm using VEXcode VR and Python. The program explores a dynamic maze, constructs a graph representation, applies the A* pathfinding algorithm, and navigates the optimal route to the destination.
Features

Maze Exploration: Uses depth-first search to map the maze.

Graph Representation: Stores maze structure as an adjacency list.

Pathfinding: Implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path.

Robot Navigation: Moves the robot along the computed path.

Return to Start: The robot navigates back to the starting point after escaping the maze.
